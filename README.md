## Features

#### üîê Multi-Sig Wallets
Butter-Fi utilizes Sub-Organizations as end-user-controlled wallets

We set up two user roles within a Sub-Organization, each with distinct permissions:

1. Admin: The root user with full access and control over all transactions.

2. Trader: A restricted API-key-only user, who can only execute transactions within predefined policies.

#### ‚öñÔ∏è Custom Transaction Policies
Butter-Fi provides predefined trading strategies, ensuring that every transaction aligns with security best practices. All transactions executed by strategies or users must adhere to clearly defined policies, mitigating risks while maintaining efficiency.

#### üõ† Embedded Wallets
Our platform offers seamless wallet integration, ensuring a frictionless user experience. Users retain 100% control over their private keys, which can be exported at any time, ensuring full self-custody.
